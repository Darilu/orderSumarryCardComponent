## My process

- look at the design model, to make plans for building styles
- First estructure in HTML. later the construction of the css.
- Definition of basic styles <*>.
- starting at the top of the page to the end. As if it were a cascade method.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- learned the basics of semantic tags to optimize other people's readability and good SEO and accessibility practices. (i hope improve my vision about this topic in the next project)

```html
<header> 
  <figure>
    <img class="image-top" src="images/illustration-hero.svg" alt="A person listening music">
  </figure>
</header>
```
- First contact with pre-established styles colors with SCSS

```scss
$background: hsl(225, 100%, 94%); //general background
$colorBtn:  hsl(245, 75%, 52%); //btn color
$backgroundApp: hsl(225, 100%, 98%); //background color of btn music image
$text: hsl(224, 23%, 55%); // color of texts
$hover: rgb(112, 101, 236);
```

### Continued development

- seek to better understand to develop a semantic HTML.
- seek to evolve and better structure my CSS pages.
- be able to better reuse the code.
